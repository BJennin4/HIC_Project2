                        <p>The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) was established on May 26, 1948 following Israel's Declaration of Independence. Today the organization operates on a budget of pver 24.3 Billion dollars and utilizes over 500,000 personel.
                           Israel launched their initial invasion of the Gaza Strip on the 27th of October, 2023. The stated goal of the operation is the elimination of Hamas. 
                           In pursuit of their goals, the IDF has dropped more than 45,000 bombs throughout the region often indiscriminately harming civilian populations.
